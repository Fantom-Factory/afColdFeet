Overview [#overview]
********************
*'Cold Feet' is a support library that aids Alien-Factory in the development of other libraries, frameworks and applications.
Though you are welcome to use it, you may find features are missing and the documentation incomplete.*

'Cold Feet' is an asset caching strategy for your [Bed App]`http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet`.

 - Tired of telling clients to clear their browser cache to pick up the latest CSS and Javascript changes?
 - Don't want lame browser cache busting because you need network performance?
 - Then get 'Cold Feet'!



Install [#Install]
******************
Install 'Cold Feet' with the Fantom Repository Manager ( [fanr]`http://fantom.org/doc/docFanr/Tool.html#install` ):

  C:\> fanr install -r http://repo.status302.com/fanr/ afColdFeet

To use in a [Fantom]`http://fantom.org/` project, add a dependency to 'build.fan':

  depends = ["sys 1.0", ..., "afColdFeet 1.1+"]



Quick Start [#quickStart]
*************************
1). Create a text file called 'Example.fan':
pre>
using afIoc
using afBedSheet
using afColdFeet

class Example {
  @Inject FileHandler? fileHandler
  @Inject ColdFeet?    coldFeet

  Text coldFeetUris() {
    msg := "Normal URI   : " + fileHandler.fromServerFile(File(`Example.fan`)).toStr + "\n"
    msg += "Cold Feet URI: " + coldFeet.fromServerFile(File(`Example.fan`)).toStr
    return Text.fromPlain(msg)
  }
}

@SubModule { modules=[ColdFeetModule#] }
class AppModule {
  @Contribute { serviceType=Routes# }
  static Void contributeRoutes(OrderedConfig conf) {
    conf.add(Route(`/`, Example#coldFeetUris))
  }

  @Contribute { serviceType=FileHandler# }
  static Void contributeFileHandler(MappedConfig config) {
    config[`/`] = `./`
  }
}

class Main {
  Int main() {
    afBedSheet::Main().main([AppModule#.qname, "8080"])
  }
}
<pre

2). Run 'Example.fan' as a Fantom script from the command line. This starts the [BedSheet]`http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet` app server:
pre>
C:\> fan Example.fan

   ___    __                 _____        _
  / _ |  / /  _____  _____  / ___/__  ___/ /_________  __ __
 / _  | / /_ / / -_|/ _  / / __// _ \/ _/ __/ _  / __|/ // /
/_/ |_|/___//_/\__|/_//_/ /_/   \_,_/__/\__/____/_/   \_, /
           Alien-Factory BedSheet v1.3.4, IoC v1.5.4 /___/

BedSheet started up in 608ms

Bed App 'Unknown' listening on http://localhost:8080/
<pre

3). Visit 'http://localhost:8080/':
pre>
Normal URI: /Example.fan
Cold Feet URI: /coldFeet/RD0EXw==/Example.fan
<pre



Usage [#usage]
**************
Contribute your asset directories to the [BedSheet]`http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet` FileHandler service as usual,
but rather than hard-coding the asset URIs, let 'Cold Feet' generate them for you.

Use the `ColdFeet` service to convert your asset URIs, such as '/css/myStyles.css', to a Cold Feet URI like '/coldFeet/XXXX/css/myStyles.css', where:

 - '/coldFeet' is a prefix used to identify the URI on incoming requests.
 - '/XXXX' is a digest, generated by Cold Feet, that changes when the asset content changes.

When a request is made for the asset using the modified URI, 'Cold Feet' intercepts the request using
[BedSheet]`http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet` middleware and serves up the file.
'Cold Feet' lets the browser aggressively cache it by setting a far-future expiration header (10 years by default).

If during those 10 years the asset is modified then the Cold Feet URI will change, as the 'XXXX' digest will be updated.
This forces the browser to download the new asset.

The smart ones amongst you will be asking, *"But what if the browser requests an old asset URI?"*
Simple, Cold Feet recognises outdated URIs and responds with a '301 - Moved Permanently' redirecting the browser to the new
asset URI.

Note that the expiration header is only enabled in production mode.



Fail Fast [#failFast]
=====================
An understated advatange of using 'Cold Feet' is that it fails fast.

Should an asset not exist on the file system (due to a bodged rename, a case sensitivity issue, or other) then 'Cold Feet' will throw an Err on the server when the browser URI is constructed.
This allows your web tests to quickly pick up these tricky errors.

The lesser appealing alternative is for the incorrect URI to be served to the browser which will subsequently recieve a '404 - Not Found'.
While this may not seem a big deal, these errors often go unnoticed and easily find their way into production.



Digest Strategies [#digests]
****************************
Adler-32 [#adler32]
===================
This is the default strategy used by 'Cold Feet'.
It calculates a digest with the [Adler-32]`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adler32` checksum algorithm.
The checksum is then Base-64 encoded using the [URL and filename safe alphabet]`http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5`.

The Adler-32 checksum was designed for speed and created for use in the [zlib]`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib` compression library which makes it an ideal fit for an asset digest.

Note that if your CSS file has a relative URL in it, such as:

  .pretty-div {
      background-image: url(../images/pretty.png);
  }

Then, under Adler-32, it will be served under the wrong digest. This is because if your CSS file is served under:

  /coldFeet/x9x9x9/css/styles.css

The browser will resolve 'pretty.png' to be under the same digest path:

  /coldFeet/x9x9x9/css/../images/pretty.png

This won't do any harm, as 'Cold Feet' will simply redirect the browser to the correct URL, but the redirect is a wasted round trip.
As each redirect creates a warning, monitor your logs to find any missed relative URLs and correct as necessary.
If there are many, you may wish to preprocess your CSS files to generate the Cold Feet URLS before serving.



App Version [#appVersion]
=========================
This simple strategy ignores the asset file in question and instead returns the application's pod version.
Thus, when a new application is deployed (with an new version), clients will re-download all the assets.

When not in production mode, the digest defaults to a random string.

To use, override the default digest strategy in your 'AppModule':

pre>
class AppModule {
    @Contribute { serviceType=ServiceOverride# }
    static Void contributeOverrides(MappedConfig config) {
        config[DigestStrategy#] = AppVersionDigest()
    }
}
<pre



Fixed Value [#fixedValue]
=========================
Use this strategy in testing. It returns a fixed / constant value each and every time.

To use, override the default digest strategy in your 'AppModule':

pre>
class AppModule {
    @Contribute { serviceType=ServiceOverride# }
    static Void contributeOverrides(MappedConfig config) {
        config[DigestStrategy#] = FixedValueDigest("XXX")
    }
}
<pre
