# Cold Feet

*`Cold Feet` is a support library that aids Alien-Factory in the development of libraries, frameworks and applications.
Though you are welcome to use it, you may find features are missing and the documentation incomplete.*

`Cold Feet` is an asset caching strategy for your [Bed App](http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet).

 - Tired of telling your clients to clear their cache to pick up the latest CSS and Javascript changes?
 - Don't want to use lame browser cache busting because you need network performance?
 - Then get 'Cold Feet'!



## Install

Install `Cold Feet` with the Fantom Respository Manager ( [fanr](http://fantom.org/doc/docFanr/Tool.html#install) ):

    C:\> fanr install -r http://repo.status302.com/fanr/ afColdFeet

To use in a [Fantom](http://fantom.org/) project, add a dependency to `build.fan`:

    depends = ["sys 1.0", ..., "afColdFeet 1.1+"]
