## Overview 

*Cold Feet is a support library that aids Alien-Factory in the development of other libraries, frameworks and applications. Though you are welcome to use it, you may find features are missing and the documentation incomplete.*

`Cold Feet` is an asset caching strategy for your [Bed App](http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet).

- Tired of telling clients to clear their browser cache to pick up the latest CSS and Javascript changes?
- Don't want lame browser cache busting because you need network performance?
- Then get `Cold Feet`!

## Install 

Install `Cold Feet` with the Fantom Repository Manager ( [fanr](http://fantom.org/doc/docFanr/Tool.html#install) ):

    C:\> fanr install -r http://repo.status302.com/fanr/ afColdFeet

To use in a [Fantom](http://fantom.org/) project, add a dependency to `build.fan`:

    depends = ["sys 1.0", ..., "afColdFeet 1.2+"]

## Documentation 

Full API & fandocs are available on the [Status302 repository](http://repo.status302.com/doc/afColdFeet/).

## Quick Start 

1). Create a text file called `Example.fan`:

```
using afIoc
using afBedSheet
using afColdFeet

class Example {
  @Inject PodHandler? podHandler

  Text coldFeetUrls() {
    asset := podHandler.fromPodResource(`fan://icons/x256/flux.png`)
    msg   := "   Normal URL: ${asset.localUrl} \n"
    msg   += "Cold Feet URL: ${asset.clientUrl}\n"
    return Text.fromPlain(msg)
  }
}

@SubModule { modules=[ColdFeetModule#] }
class AppModule {
  @Contribute { serviceType=Routes# }
  static Void contributeRoutes(Configuration conf) {
    conf.add(Route(`/`, Example#coldFeetUrls))
  }
}

class Main {
  Int main() {
    afBedSheet::Main().main([AppModule#.qname, "8080"])
  }
}
```

2). Run `Example.fan` as a Fantom script from the command line. This starts the [BedSheet](http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet) app server:

```
C:\> fan Example.fan
   ___    __                 _____        _
  / _ |  / /_____  _____    / ___/__  ___/ /_________  __ __
 / _  | / // / -_|/ _  /===/ __// _ \/ _/ __/ _  / __|/ // /
/_/ |_|/_//_/\__|/_//_/   /_/   \_,_/__/\__/____/_/   \_, /
          Alien-Factory BedSheet v1.3.14, IoC v1.7.6 /___/

IoC Registry built in 612ms and started up in 104ms

Bed App 'Unknown' listening on http://localhost:8080/
```

3). Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

```
Normal URL: /pods/icons/x256/flux.png
d Feet URL: /coldFeet/infYBQ==/pods/icons/x256/flux.png<pre
```

## Usage 

Contribute your asset directories to the BedSheet [FileHandler](http://repo.status302.com/doc/afBedSheet/FileHandler.html) service as usual, but rather than hard-coding the asset URLs, let `Cold Feet` generate them for you.

`Cold Feet` invisibly instruments the `FileHandler` service to add a caching strategy to the generated client URLs. An asset URL such as ``/css/myStyles.css`` magically becomes a `Cold Feet` URL like ``/coldFeet/XXXX/css/myStyles.css``, where:

- `/coldFeet` is a prefix used to identify the URL on incoming requests.
- `/XXXX` is a digest, generated by Cold Feet, that changes when the asset content changes.

When a request is made for the asset using the modified URL, `Cold Feet` intercepts the request using [BedSheet](http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/afBedSheet) middleware and serves up the file.

`Cold Feet` lets the browser aggressively cache these files by setting a far-future expiration header on it (1 year by default). Note this expiration header is only enabled in production; see [IoC Env](http://www.fantomfactory.org/pods/IocEnv).

If during that 1 year the asset is modified then the `Cold Feet` URL will change, just as the `XXXX` digest changes. This forces the browser to download the new asset.

The smart ones amongst you will be asking, *"But what if the browser requests an old asset URL?"* Simple, `Cold Feet` recognises outdated URLs and responds with a `301 - Moved Permanently` redirecting the browser to the new asset URL.

## What Usage? 

Because `Cold Feet` works in the background, invisibly advising the `FileHandler` and `PodHandler` services, there is no *Cold Feet Usage* per se. Just add `Cold Feet` as a project dependency and optionally configure a digest.

Then use `FileHandler` and `PodHandler` to generate client URLs to your files, and use them your web pages.

## Digest Strategies 

### Adler-32 

This is the default strategy used by `Cold Feet`. It calculates a digest with the [Adler-32](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adler32) checksum algorithm. The checksum is then Base-64 encoded using the [URL and filename safe alphabet](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5).

The Adler-32 checksum was designed for speed and created for use in the [zlib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib) compression library which makes it an ideal fit for an asset digest.

Note that if your CSS file has a relative URL in it, such as:

    .pretty-div {
        background-image: url(../images/pretty.png);
    }

Then, under Adler-32, it will be served under the wrong digest. This is because if your CSS file is served under:

    /coldFeet/x9x9x9/css/styles.css

The browser will resolve `pretty.png` to be under the same digest path:

    /coldFeet/x9x9x9/css/../images/pretty.png

This won't do any harm, as `Cold Feet` will simply redirect the browser to the correct URL, but the redirect is a wasted round trip. As each redirect creates a warning, monitor your logs to find any missed relative URLs and correct as necessary. If there are many, you may wish to preprocess your CSS files to generate the Cold Feet URLs before serving.

### App Version 

This simple strategy ignores the asset file in question and instead returns the application's pod version. Thus, when a new application is deployed (with an new version), clients will re-download all the assets.

When not in production mode, the digest defaults to a random string.

To use, override the default digest strategy in your `AppModule`:

```
class AppModule {
    @Contribute { serviceType=ServiceOverrides# }
    static Void contributeOverrides(Configuration config) {
        config[DigestStrategy#] = AppVersionDigest()
    }
}
```

### Fixed Value 

Use this strategy in testing. It returns a fixed / constant value each and every time.

To use, override the default digest strategy in your `AppModule`:

```
class AppModule {
    @Contribute { serviceType=ServiceOverrides# }
    static Void contributeOverrides(Configuration config) {
        config[DigestStrategy#] = FixedValueDigest("XXX")
    }
}
```
